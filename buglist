============ TSteelworks buglist ============

Deep tank:
    Draining a tank w/ a filter doesn't work if the fluid isn't at the bottom -- could be a ExU error

============ TSteelworks todolist ============

Register bucket usage to the dispenser https://github.com/CoFH/ThermalFoundation/blob/master/src/main/java/thermalfoundation/fluid/TFFluids.java

High oven:
    NEI plugin for recipes
    FMLIntermodComs to add recipes

Important:
    Make the turbine a servant & valid as a deep tank block

The high oven should lookup the smeltery recipes if the item is not smeltable (and remove every copied recipe from the high oven)
